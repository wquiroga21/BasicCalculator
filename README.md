# Overview

As a software engineer major that is continuously seeking growth and learning opportunities, I've developed a simple command-line calculator application. The goal of this project was not only to deepen my understanding of the C++ programming language but also to demonstrate its practical application in creating user-friendly programs.

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Through the development of this software, I've explored core concepts of C++, including control structures, functions, error handling, and more. Additionally, the project serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming by employing a class structure to encapsulate the functionality of the calculator.

My purpose for writing this software was to challenge myself with a foundational project that applies essential programming principles, thereby enhancing my capabilities as a developer.

# Development Environment

The tools I used for the development of this calculator software include:

- Visual Studio Code: A versatile code editor for C++ development.
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): A compiler system for compiling C++ code.
- Git: Version control system to manage code changes.

The primary programming language used is C++. The project utilizes the Standard Template Library (STL) for managing the calculation history, showcasing the use of vectors to store a dynamic list of operations.

# Future Work

Here are some enhancements that I aim to implement in future iterations of the calculator software:

- Implementing a GUI to improve user interaction.
- Adding more complex mathematical operations and functions.
- Creating an option to export the calculation history to a file.
